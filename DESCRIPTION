Description: The project is for data experts who use R at scale. The project
    comes together as an R package that will allow users to run their R code in
    parallel across a cluster hosted on Azure. The cluster will be created and
    maintained by Azure Batch and, for the initial version, will be a public/
    communal pool. The orchestration for each job that needs to be parallelized in
    the cluster will be done by a middle layer that schedules each request.
