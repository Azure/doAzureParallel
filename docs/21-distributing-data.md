# Distributing Data

The doAzureParallel package lets you distribute the data you have in your R session across your Azure pool.

As long as the data you wish to distribute can fit in-memory on your local machine as well as in the memory of the VMs in your pool, the doAzureParallel package will be able to manage the data.

```R
my_data_set <- data_set
number_of_iterations <- 10

results <- foreach(i = 1:number_of_iterations) %dopar% {
  runAlgorithm(my_data_set)
}
```

## Chunking Data

A common scenario would be to chunk your data accross the pool so that your R code is running agaisnt a single chunk. In doAzureParallel, we help you achieve this by iterating through your chunks so that each chunk is mapped to an interation of the distributed *foreach* loop.

```R
chunks <- split(<data_set>, 10)

results <- foreach(chunk = iter(chunks)) %dopar% {
  runAlgorithm(chunk)
}
```

## Pre-loading Data Into The Cluster

Some workloads may require data pre-loaded into the cluster as soon as the cluster is provisioned. doAzureParallel supports this with the concept of a *resource file* - a file that is automatically downloaded to each node of the cluster after the cluster is created. 

Here's an example that uses data stored in a public location on Azure Blob Storage:

```R
# define where to download data from
resource_files = list(
    list(
        url = "https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/2010.csv",
        filePath = "2010.csv"
    ),
    list(
        url = "https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/2011.csv",
        filePath = "2011.csv"
    )
)

# add the parameter 'resourceFiles'
cluster <- makeCluster("creds.json", "cluster.json", resourceFiles = resource_files)

# when the cluster is provisioned, register the cluster as your parallel backend
registerDoAzureParallel(cluster)

# the preloaded files are located in the location: "$AZ_BATCH_NODE_STARTUP_DIR/wd"
listFiles <- foreach(i = 2010:2011, .combine='c') %dopar% {
    fileDirectory <- paste0(Sys.getenv("AZ_BATCH_NODE_STARTUP_DIR"), "/wd")
    return(list.files(fileDirectory))
}

# this will print out "2010.csv" and "2011.csv"
```
